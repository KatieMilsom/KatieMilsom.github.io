								<!-- <p>A protoplanetary disc can become warped (where the disc plane is not constant with radius) if it is perturbed by an external force.

									warps include shadows cast in scattered light images as the warp blocks the stellar light from reaching the outer disc.

								<h2>Warp induced by a fly-by</h2>
								<p>If a fly-by (a stellar perturber on an unbound orbit) passes close to a protoplanetary disc it can induce a warp 
									(where the disc plane is not constant with radius) in 
									the outer disc. The warp can cast a shadow in scattered light images as it blocks the stellar light from reaching parts of the disc.
									
									This can be seen in the movies below. On the left we show the disc (represented by blue rings) warp
									due to a peturbing fly-by (red circle). On the right we show scattered light models in which we can see the shadows 
									induced by the warp.	
								</p>

													type="video/mp4" />
								</video> 
								<p>The fly-by travels on a path orthgonal to the disc plane and reaches its closest approach (200au from the outer disc) at 2000 years where it passes
									through the disc plane (see model 1 from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.403.1887N/abstract" target="_blank">Nixon et al 2010</a>).
									As it travels towards the disc plane (from below as seen in the movie) the outer disc is perturbed and warps. As the fly-by passes through the disc
									plane the torque acting on the disc changes direction and the warp flips to the opposite side of the disc. The shadow cast by the warp also
									flips to the other side of the disc. This switch in direction of the torque causes the warp to oscillate back and forth about
									a constant axis (causing the shadow to move back and forth across the disc) long after the fly-by has passed.
								</p> 

								<h4><b>What if the fly-by travels at an angle to the disc plane?</b></h4>

											<source src='images/flyby_model2.mp4' 
													type="video/mp4" />
								</video> 

								<p>In the model above the path of the fly-by is no longer orthogonal to the disc plane, but at an angle to it 
									(see model 2 from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.403.1887N/abstract" target="_blank">Nixon et al 2010</a>). 
									As before, the outer disc warps due to the fly-by and a shadow is cast in the outer disc. However a twist is induced in the disc as 
									the fly-by approaches causing the 
									induced shadow to rotate round. Again, as the fly-by passes through the disc plane the direction of the torque
									acting on the disc quickly switches and the warp (and induced shadow) flips to the other side of the disc.
									This causes the warp (and induced shadow) to oscillate back and forth after the fly-by passes.
									The shadow oscillates about a constant axis, but since there was a twist incuded as the the fly-by passed, this axis
									is at an angle to that in the model where the fly-by's path is orthogonal to the disc plane.<br></br>
								</p>

								
								<h2>Warp induced by an planet on an inclined orbit</h2>

								<p> A planet with an orbit inclined with respect to the disc plane can perturb a protoplanetary disc. If the planet is 
									external to the disc it can cause the disc to tilt and precess round, but internal to the disc it can induce a warp
									in the disc which propagates outwards. In this model we combine these two scenarios to show a planet orbiting 
									in a gap between an inner and outer disc. <br></br>
									
									In the movie below, on the left we show the disc (blue) and orbit of the inclined planet (red). The right shows scattered 
									light models and the shadows induced by the perturbed disc. The model is based on that from 
									<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484.4951N/abstract" target="_blank">Nealon et al 2019</a>.

								</video> 
								<p>The inclined planet induces a warp in the outer disc, but causes the inner disc to tilt and precess round. The warp
									in the outer disc casts a shadow in the North (top) of the image, whereas the tilted inner disc casts a shadow
									which starts in the North, but moves clockwise round as the inner disc precesses. <br></br>

									The shadow in the outer disc moves outwards as the warp propagates through the disc. A bright band is also seen 
									in the outer disc which marks the wave front of the warp as it moves outwards. <br></br>
									
									The tilted inner disc initially shadows the same region
									as the warp in the outer disc. However, as the inner disc precesses round, the shadow moves round so
									at ~4700 years (or 420 rotations of the planet) over half of the disc is in shadow 
									(see snapshots below). This is because the warp in the outer disc casts the shadow in the North, but the precessing inner disc
									casts a second shadow in the South, overall casting a shadow across more than half the outer disc.<br></br>
